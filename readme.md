# SilverStripe Intercom Module

This module provides SilverStripe integration for [Intercom](https://www.intercom.io/).

and help others make use of your modules.

## Requirements
 * SilverStripe Framework 3.1 or higher (4.0 untested). Works nicely with the CMS but it isn't required.

## Installation
Install the module with composer, just like all your favourite module!

```
composer require sminnee/silverstripe-intercom
```

## License
See [License](license.md)

## How it works
Intercom's integration is quite simple: a few lines of JavaScript added just before the `</body>` tag.
The module adds through its own RequestFilter.

## Configuration

The module will make use of the following global constants in your `_ss_environment.php` file. You should 
set these up

 * `INTERCOM_APP_ID`: The "App ID" from Intercom's integration settings. Required.
 * `INTERCOM_API_KEY`: The "API key" from Intercom's integration settings. Required.
 * `INTERCOM_SECRET_KEY`: The secret key given by Intercom's Secure Mode. Optional, but highly recommended.

Note that if you disclose your secret key to anyone, they could impersonate users of your app and chat to 
your support team, so keep it secure! The App ID is less sensitive as it is in the HTML source of your 
site.

I recommend that you provide enable the "Test Version" of Intercom. This will give you a second App ID that
you should use on your test and development environments.

Your application can customise the information send with the following properties

````
Sminnee\SilverStripeIntercom\IntercomScriptTag:
  anonymous_access: true
  company_property: Organisation
  company_fields:
    name: Title
    plan: AccountPlan
  user_fields:
    favourite_colour: FavouriteColour
```

 * `anonymous_access`: If true, then the integration code will be supplied even for anonmyous visitors.
   This is used for Intercom Acquire.
 * `company_property`: The property on a member that points to their organisation
 * `company_fields`: A map of Intercom field name to organisation properties to pass through
 * `user_fields`: A map of Intercom field name to member properties to pass through


### Only show Intercom sometimes

The `Sminnee\SilverStripeIntercom\IntercomScriptTags` class has a configuration value, `enabled`, that
can will disable any inclusion of Intercom script tags if set to false.

If you wish to show Intercom only sometimes, you can update this configuration value at any time during
your page load, with the following command. For example, you may choose to show Intercom only on certain
pages, or for certain users.

```
Sminnee\SilverStripeIntercom\IntercomScriptTags::config()->enabled = false;
```

## Usage

### Tracking events

You can track events with the `Intercom::trackEvent()` method. The event will be tracked against the
current user.

    $intercom = Injector::inst()->get('Sminnee\SilverStripeIntercom\Intercom');
    $intercom->trackEvent('test-event', array(
      'something' => 'a value',
      'other-one' => 'moar data',
    ));

You can also explicitly specify which user this event should be tracked against:
 
 	$member = Member::get()->byID(34);
	$intercom = Injector::inst()->get('Sminnee\SilverStripeIntercom\Intercom');
	$intercom->trackEvent('test-event', array(
		'something' => 'a value',
		'other-one' => 'moar data',
	), $member);
 

Note that you can't currently track events for anonymous visitors; a LogicException will be thrown if you 
try.
